# telecome-management-system
This project is designed to manage telecommunication services. In this project, we can add customers along with their IDs. We can also update customer names and manage both prepaid and postpaid plans. The system allows us to update plan details, calculate billing and payments, track usage and services, and generate search results and reports.
